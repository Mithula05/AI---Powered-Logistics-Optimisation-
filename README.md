🚚 AI-Powered Logistics Optimization
📌 Overview
This project is a prototype for AI-driven logistics optimization, designed to reduce delivery delays, minimize costs, and improve overall efficiency in supply chain operations.
The system uses Machine Learning algorithms to predict delivery times, optimize routes, and provide real-time re-routing suggestions based on factors such as traffic, distance, vehicle type, and package weight.
⚡ Features
📍 Route Optimization – Finds the most efficient delivery path
⏱ Real-Time Delivery Time Prediction – Based on live conditions
🚦 Dynamic Re-Routing – Adjusts to traffic & environmental changes
📊 Dashboard Visualization – For monitoring shipments & alerts
🔮 Scalability – Extendable to multi-city or large-scale logistics
🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools:
scikit-learn – Machine Learning models
pandas, numpy – Data processing
matplotlib – Visualization
Flask/Streamlit (optional) – Dashboard/Prototype UI
Data Inputs: Distance, traffic level, vehicle type, package weight
